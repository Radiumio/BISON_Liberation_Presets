# Black Talon
Black Talon is an international, clandestine mercenary organisation for hire. There are extensive rumours regarding their funding and sources of operators from across the globe - but consistent reports make no mistake; Black Talon is extremely well-armed and very well-trained.

BT's specialization lies in their ability to deploy air vehicles at a surprisingly low cost. Unsurprisingly, this leads to a reliance on air vehicles for transport and field operations, making it somewhat of a downside. While the organisation does have a plethora of other vehicles at its disposal, the expense in requisitioning these is generally not worth it.

**NOTE:**
*This preset is designed to be difficult. Ground vehicles are slightly more costly than usual, and armed variants even more so. Tanks, and heavy armour are much more expensive. However, as per Black Talon's specialization, transport helicopters can be as cheap as a quadbike or MRAP - with some even being outright free. Armed helicopters and gunships are relatively cheaper than normal, however jets and so forth are still expensive to acquire and maintain.* 

Vehicles with **[ELITE LOCK]** have a chance to be randomly locked by a military base upon campaign start.

- Custom, unique FOB and convoy names. FOBs are cheaper to encourage more FOB creations, due to the lack of vehicles.

- Taru, Taru Pods, Orcas, Quad Bikes, AMV-7 Marshalls, and Little Birds will adopt a 'Black' camo scheme.
- The Transport Taru - while not capable of slingloading - can carry 36 units of cargo, meaning 6 crates in ACE Cargo, as an option for starter logistics.
- The Xi'an Infantry Transport can carry 48 units of cargo (8 boxes), whereas the Vehicle Variant can carry 72 (12 boxes).
- Black Eagles, Zamak MRLs, Qilins, AA/SAM sites, Offroads will be 'Green'.

The stock Taru is made even more powerful logistics-wise with the **[XENO - Taru Pod Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=365549234)** as it can equip a wide range of mission-specific pods, allowing it to repair, refuel, rearm, provide medical facilities and even a mobile respawn, mid-field.
