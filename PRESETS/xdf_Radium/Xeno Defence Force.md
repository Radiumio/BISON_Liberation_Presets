# Xeno Defence Force
Publically, not much is known about the XDF - even their existence and size is a well-kept secret. Having operated for several decades, the XDF emerged at the same time as the alien threat, formed by a multinational coalition between the leaders of several powerful countries. Despite political tensions, the threat of alien invasion has forced those aware of the danger to set aside their differences, and work to stop our extraterrestrial enemy.

As is necessary for such an organisation, the XDF employs some of the world's brightest minds in order to study the alien threat. Many of the foreign technologies recovered in the field have been used to develop hybrid weapons and equipment used by XDF operators, and create powerful variants of modern aircraft and ground vehicles that are capable of standing up to their otherworldly opponents. It is believed that the XDF operates in independent cells, so as to avoid being toppled by evasive alien infiltrators or moles.

Despite this unlikely show of collaboration, the threat of alien invasion grows ever closer. Panic spreads throughout the world as localized alien incursions become more frequent. Tensions between global powers are increasing - all orchestrated by our extraterrestrial neighbours who aim to secure our planet. If nothing is done, humanity is certainly doomed to go extinct. The XDF must act.

## Unique/Notable Features
- Custom, unique FOB and convoy names. FOBs are cheaper to encourage more FOB creations, due to the lack of vehicles.
- The Wraith Infantry Transport can carry 48 units of cargo (8 boxes), whereas the Vehicle Variant can carry 72 (12 boxes).

The Medusa heavy-lift helicopter is made even more powerful logistics-wise with the **[XENO - Taru Pod Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=365549234)** as it can equip a wide range of mission-specific pods, allowing it to repair, refuel, rearm, provide medical facilities and even a mobile respawn, mid-field.
