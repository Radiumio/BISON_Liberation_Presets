# Triton Private Military Corporation
'Triton' is a Eastern-backed PMC notorious for its tendency to work for the highest bidder. While primarily sporting Russian gear, hundreds of elite operatives apart of Triton, known as 'Ravens', are given the best gear, and tasked with waging proxy wars on behalf of their benefactors.

Although the PMC holds a pool of armored vehicles and armed attack helicopters, they are incredibly expensive to requisition, and as such the PMC often finds itself using 'hit-and-run' strike tactics, with cheap LSV's and helicopters at their disposal. 

In the ongoing international conflict, there is little room for hesitation, and a constantly growing demand for contractors who find the hazard pay more than worthwhile.

**NOTE:**
*This preset is INTENTIONALLY designed to be difficult. Even basic armor vehicles or vehicles sporting high-grade weapon capabilities are EXTREMELY expensive. The intent is to reward hard work in obtaining equipment and punishing mistakes/losses, encouraging players to focus on ground-ops and quick strike operations, and stealing enemy vehicles.* 

*FOBs are also cheap, to encourage players to deploy multiple FOBs more often.*

Vehicles with **[ELITE LOCK]** have a chance to be randomly locked by a military base upon campaign start.

- The Transport Taru - while not capable of slingloading - can carry 36 units of cargo, meaning 6 crates in ACE Cargo, as an option for starter logistics.
- The Xi'an Infantry Transport can carry 48 units of cargo (8 boxes), whereas the Vehicle Variant can carry 72 (12 boxes).
- Black Eagles, Zamak MRLs, Qilins, AA/SAM sites, Offroads will be 'Green'.
