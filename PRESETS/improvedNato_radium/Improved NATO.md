# Improved NATO
This version of the vanilla NATO faction expands upon their selection of decorative objects, adds new enemy vehicles to their air pool, and more, such as...

## Air Vehicles
- Mi-290 Taru
- Mi-290 Taru (Ammo)
- Mi-290 Taru (Bench)
- Mi-290 Taru (Cargo)
- Mi-290 Taru (Fuel)
- Mi-290 Taru (Medical)
- Mi-290 Taru (Repair)
- Mi-290 Taru (Transport)
- Mi-48 Kajman Gunship

## Supports
- Taru Ammo Pod
- Taru Cargo Pod
- Taru Fuel Pod
- Taru Repair Pod
- Taru Medical Pod
- Taru Transport Pod

The stock Taru is made even more powerful logistics-wise with the **[XENO - Taru Pod Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=365549234)** as it can equip a wide range of mission-specific pods, allowing it to repair, refuel, rearm and provide medical facilities mid-field.

## Object Inits
- Nyx's now use the **Olive** paintjob instead of the **AAF** digi-camo.
- Taru's and their respective pods, as well as the Kajman, are retextured to the **Black** paintjob to make it more faction-neutral.
